<h1>Grand Theft Auto V</h1>
<p>
    <small>2020-02-20</small>
    <p><strong>Gameplay</strong>
The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clintonâ€”criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character and others feature two or three.</p>

<p><strong>Player skills</strong>
Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth "special" skill determines the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each respective character.</p>

<p><strong>Abilities (Only available in single player)</strong>
Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while taking half as much in combat.</p>
