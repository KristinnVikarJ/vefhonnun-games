<h1>Rocket League</h1>
<p>
    <small>2020-02-20</small>
    <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>

<p>Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of mechanics you can learn in Rocket League and the more you mechanics you know the more opertunities you get to score or save.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Mechanics</strong></p>

<p>Aerial: when you use boost to get higher into the air to hit the ball.
Wave dash: in RL you can flip to go faster bot it takes some time to finish the flip so people found out a way to cancel the flip on the ground by flipping while falling close to the ground/walls/ceiling. </p>
