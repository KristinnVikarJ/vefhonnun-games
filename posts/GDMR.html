<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>

<p>The game is a simple platformer game thats based on Grand Dad (A Bootleg copy of mario and fred flintstone) and his adventures in the siivagunner universe.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanics</strong></p>

<p>There are quite a few mechanics in the game, depending on what character you are playing you get a main ability
<strong>Grand Dad</strong> has the ledge ability where he is able to hang onto a ledge and climb up it.
<strong>Small Nozomi</strong> has the ability to fly using her hair for a short period of time.
<strong>Nigra</strong> has the ability to slide on the ground allowing him to get into cramped spaces and tunnels.</p>

<p><strong>What I Worked On</strong></p>

<p>I helped write base code for the Entities/Enemies in the game, along with some Enemy behaviour.</p>
