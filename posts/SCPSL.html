<p><strong>What I Worked On</strong></p>

<p>I work as a Backend-developer for this game, which means I handle everything from optimizing the game to networking and security, some of the things I've worked on in the game include, the voice chat system, the translation system, quite a bit of networking work and a whole lot of other things.</p>
