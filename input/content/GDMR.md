__Gameplay__

The game is a simple platformer game thats based on Grand Dad (A Bootleg copy of mario and fred flintstone) and his adventures in the siivagunner universe.

__Mechanics__

There are quite a few mechanics in the game, depending on what character you are playing you get a main ability
**Grand Dad** has the ledge ability where he is able to hang onto a ledge and climb up it.
**Small Nozomi** has the ability to fly using her hair for a short period of time.
**Nigra** has the ability to slide on the ground allowing him to get into cramped spaces and tunnels.

__What I Worked On__

I helped write base code for the Entities/Enemies in the game, along with some Enemy behaviour.
