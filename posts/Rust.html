<h1>Rust</h1>
<p>
    <small>2020-02-20</small>
    <p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>

<p>As a multiplayer-only video game, Rust puts players against each other in a harsh, open world environment with the sole goal of survival. Animals, such as wolves and bears, act as a looming threat, but the primary danger comes from other players. Most maps are procedurally generated, with the exception of Hapis Island, a pre-built map. Player vs player (PvP) combat is accomplished with bows, melee weapons and craftable guns.</p>

<p><strong>In-game events</strong>
There are 2 in-game events where one of them is Airdrop where theres a box full og loot that drops down from the sky, the 2nd one is Attack Helicopter where there'll be a helicopter flying over the sky until you attack it then the helicopter will start flying over you and try to kill you with its powerfull guns.</p>
